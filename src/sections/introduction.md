## What is this about
- Math Art (?)
- Shape composition
- Stumbling upon mathematics relationships
- Composing behaviors

## What we'll go over
- Canvas API
- Motion
- P5
- Forces
- Collision (+ optimization)
- fractals

## What we won't cover
- Game logic
- Valid Math
- Serious Physics



We will go over the basics of the Canvas API
After learning about drawing primitives, we'll have a look at the P5 library.

Once we are comfortable drawing shapes on a canvas, we'll discuss forces and motion.

Managing complex interactions can become messy.

Force -> acceleration -> velocity -> position
Drag
Friction
Gravity
Spring

combining forces

composing mapping functions to attribute values

fractals
