(`p.rotate`)\\n- grows shorter (`p.scale`)\\n\\neach child then starts growing children of its own until the maxGeration cap is reached\\n\\n### Other Fractals\\nhttp://remyyounes.github.io/fractalizeru/\\n\\n```code\\n<div>\\n  <Tree\\n    generations={8}\\n    baseScale={0.77}\\n    baseLength={150}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/sections/tree.md\n// module id = ./src/sections/tree.md\n// module chunks = 0"],"mappings":";;;;;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
